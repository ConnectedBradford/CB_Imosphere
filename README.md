# CB_Imosphere 

Thsi repository will contain the code that IMOSPHERE used to build a cdm using primary and secondary care data , this CDM build is opver 2 years out of date so as part of our migration to an alternative google platform was removed, however the code remains and will be applied to a "new" CDM build.
